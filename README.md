# old-web
old content from my personal website used years ago

lookitskris.holding contains the holding page that was up for years, including some cool artwork from lost - not penny's boat!

lookitskris.main has the code for a 1 page scrolling website with stuff about me and projects I worked on at the time.

Think this was up around 2012, perhaps even earlier.
